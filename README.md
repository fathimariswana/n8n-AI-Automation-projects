2. Use Case Description 
  This workflow automates the process of announcing new YouTube video uploads on LinkedIn. When a new video is detected via an RSS feed, the workflow drafts a LinkedIn post using AI, sends it to a manager for approval via email, and publishes the post upon approval. The workflow prevents 
  duplicate posts, logs all actions to Google Sheets, and provides robust 
  error handling for each critical step. This automation saves time for 
  marketing teams, ensures content quality through human review, and 
  maintains a transparent log for auditing.
